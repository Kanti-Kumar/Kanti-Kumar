Hello Everyone! 👋

I am Kanti Kumar, a 3rd-year B.Tech student at Shri Vishwakarma Skill University, specializing in Computer Science(AI and ML). 

I am deeply interested in Machine Learning, deep learning, data science and the exciting ways AI is transforming the world. I am fascinated by the potential of data to solve complex problems and am passionate about making an impact through technology.

I am currently learning advanced techniques in Machine Learning. I am also sharpening my skills with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn and TensorFlow.

I am looking to collaborate in ML/AI projects, particularly those that challenge me to apply and expand my knowledge. If you’re working on something innovative, I did love to contribute and learn together.

Let's connect and share ideas!
